    <h1>Kawhi Leonard's Early Life</h1>
    <p>Kawhi Leonard grew up in Compton California, to a struggling family who's only source of income was his father's car wash, Kawhi often helped around the house<br> and was know to be a very kind child.
    Once Kawhi got to highschool he started playing football and basketball, and due to his hulking stature and unparalelled skill, he became nationally ranked, <br>at the age of 16 Kawhi decided to stick with basketball as his main sport 
    and took up work at his dads car wash. However life took a sharp turn for Kawhi, as on January 19, a random driveby shooting on his father's <br>carwash would claim the life of Kawhi's <strong>father</strong>, and in a moment of 
    strength and defiance, Kawhi would play in a highschool game that very night, dropping 19 points. After that day, Kawhi became far more stoic, <br>losing himself in basketball and getting drafted to the NBA.
    Not much was expected of Kawhi as a player, but in just his third year he would breakout as a star, and the rest is history, <br>tallying up Championships and defensive awards and cementing himself as 
    one of the greatest to ever play basketball.</p>
